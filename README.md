### What I learned

During this practical challenge, I learned about the basic uses of flexbox. I also learned how to adjust the page to fit different viewports using the vh and vw units. Another thing I discovered was that converting color values from hsl to hex may not be the best idea. Finally, I learned how to use Markdown syntax on readme files.

### Useful resources

- [The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) - I've finished the CSS section of the course and currently, I'm taking a break to work on some projects before continuing with the rest of the course. I want to make sure that I have a good grasp of what I've learned so far.

- [Chat Gpt](https://chat.openai.com/) - Very interesting and useful tool. It helped me with debugging, organizing my CSS file, and adding comments to my code.

## Final Notes
---

This was my first project on my own, and my third total. It was challenging at first because I didn't have a tutorial to follow, but I got the hang of it eventually. 

As a way of keeping track of my progress and to serve as a reference for future projects, I decided to comment my code thoroughly. I'm really pleased with the final result of the project - the layout looks great and it works seamlessly on different screen sizes. Overall, I'm proud of the skills I've gained and the progress I've made in my journey to becoming a proficient web developer.
